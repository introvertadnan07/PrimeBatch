    <p><b>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,</b> how I wonder what you are.<br> Up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.<br>
When the blazing sun is set, and the grass with dew is wet. <br> Then you show your little
light, twinkle, twinkle all the night.<br> Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you
are.
<u>Then the traveler in the dark thanks you for your tiny spark.</u><br> How could he see where to
go if you did not twinkle so? Twinkle, twinkle little star, <br>how I wonder what you are.<br>
As your bright and tiny spark lights the traveler in the dark, though I know not what you <br>
are, twinkle, twinkle, little star. <br>Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.</p>
