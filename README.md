Day-1 – Python Basics

This folder contains the introductory Python programs covered on Day-1 of the PrimeBatch series. These exercises focus on basic syntax, user input, simple operations, and foundational logic.

What’s inside
1. sum.py

A simple program to add two numbers and print the result.

2. Average.py

Takes multiple numbers, calculates the average, and displays the output.

3. UserInput.py

Shows how to take input from the user using the input() function and work with it.

4. code.py

General practice code for basic Python operations such as printing, variables, and simple calculations.

Skills learned

Working with variables

Using input()

Type conversion (int, float)

Basic arithmetic


Printing formatted output
Day-2 – Conditional Statements and Looping

This folder contains the programs practiced on Day-2 of the PrimeBatch series. The focus for this day was understanding how Python makes decisions using conditions and how loops help repeat actions.

Files included
1. IfElse.py

Shows how to use if, elif, and else statements for decision making.

2. Loops.py

Covers both for and while loops, including examples of iteration and repeated execution.

3. Table.py

Generates a multiplication table using loops.

4. EvenOdd.py

Takes a number and checks whether it is even or odd.

Skills learned

Using if, elif, and else

Understanding Boolean conditions

Writing for and while loops

Using break and continue (if practiced)

Building simple logic-based programs

Day-3 – Functions and File Handling

This folder contains the programs practiced on Day-3 of the PrimeBatch series. The focus for today was understanding how to create and use functions, along with the basics of reading and writing files in Python.

Files included

(Update filenames if needed)

1. Function.py

Shows how to define and call functions, use parameters, return values, and organize code.

2. ATM.py

A simple ATM simulation using functions to handle actions like deposit, withdraw, and balance check.

3. Library.py

Demonstrates how functions can manage items in a collection, such as adding books, issuing books, or viewing available items.

4. File.py

Covers basic file handling. It includes writing data to a file, reading it back, and handling common file operations.

Skills learned

Writing and calling functions

Using parameters and return values

Organizing code into reusable blocks

Basic file operations (open, read, write)

Handling simple logic within functions

Managing small systems like ATM and Library using Python functions
